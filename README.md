# Spaghetti Chess
A homebrew chess engine built in C++ with cross-compiled JS for browser support! Based off a mini-max algorithm but includes alpha-beta pruning, move ordering, quiescence search, and other modifications for efficiency and playing strength. Is UCI compatible and thus works with any chess GUI.
